    <h1>About Squid Game</h1>

    <h2>The Series</h2>
    <p>"Squid Game" is a South Korean survival drama television series created by Hwang Dong-hyuk. The series revolves around a contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial debt, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for a chance to win a â‚©45.6 billion prize. The show has captivated audiences worldwide with its intense storyline, complex characters, and social commentary on issues such as economic disparity and human nature.</p>

    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>Inspired by the gripping narrative and thrilling challenges of the "Squid Game" series, we have developed an engaging web game that brings the excitement of the series to life. Our project aims to recreate the tension and strategy of the series' games while providing a safe and entertaining experience for players.</p>

    <h2>How We Built It</h2>
    <p>Our web game is built using modern web development technologies to ensure a seamless and immersive experience. Here are the key components and tools we used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML5</strong>: For structuring the content and creating the layout of the game.</li>
      <li><strong>CSS3</strong>: For styling the game elements and ensuring a visually appealing design.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the game.</li>
      <li><strong>Node.js</strong>: For building the server-side logic and handling game state management.</li>
      <li><strong>Express.js</strong>: For creating the web server and defining the routes for different game stages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Have Used</h2>
    <p>We utilized a variety of tools and resources to bring this project to life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>: Our primary code editor for writing and debugging code.</li>
      <li><strong>Git</strong>: For version control and managing our codebase.</li>
      <li><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>: For creating and editing game assets and graphics.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong>: For selecting and integrating custom fonts to enhance the game's aesthetics.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our project is a testament to the power of collaboration and creativity. We hope you enjoy playing our "Squid Game" web game as much as we enjoyed building it!</p>
